## Resumen

> The “Beyond 60 days” Project is an uninterruptible power supply system that will keep the different devices that are part of the exploration missions to Venus in operation.

The challenge is to keep the exploration platforms energized for a minimum of 60 days in hostile conditions with high surface temperatures of Venus of around 460 C and an atmospheric pressure of 94 bar.
 The implementation of an analogous energy system is proposed, made up of a set of thermocouples that supply 24 volts to different instruments of the rover, which will be interconnected to a high performance batteries pack cover with a thermal insulation.
Venus being an inner planet closer to the sun with respect to the earth, its study will allow the collection of data on its atmosphere, geological evolution and its internal structure, the importance of carrying out Venusian missions of more than 60 days with systems adapted to the infernal environment and relentless of Venus is a challenge.
 Our system consists of:
- 4 thermocouple plates.
- 1 battery pack
- 1 Rover
